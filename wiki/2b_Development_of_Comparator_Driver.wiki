= Introduction =
Here is described the development of LPCOMP driver, the Low Power Comparator peripheral drivers of nRF51822. The LPCOMP compares an input voltage (VIN+), which comes from an analog input pin selected through the PSEL register against a reference voltage (VIN-) selected through the REFSEL and EXTREFSEL registers. In this application is compared (VIN+) with VDD/2 (VDD*4/8).

== The circuit to test the comparator ==

To emulate the voltage pulse due to the crossing of the magnet above the coil was build a simple circuit. The circuit consists of a button (SW1) to trigger a positive voltage (Vcc=3 V) on a MCU's comparator pin (P0.03) and a one-pole RC circuit (R1 and C1) that remove the button's bounces.
P3 is the on-board 2x5 male pin header of the PCA10001.

The R-C circuit has a charge-time-constant tc=10 ms and a discharge-time-constant td=20 ms thus the mechanical bounces are bypassed and button presses could be detected.

P0.03 correspond to the ADC/LPCOMP input 4 (AIN4).
