#summary Setup of MDK-ARM IDE and download of blinky example on the Evaluation board PCA10001.

= Introduction =



== IDE & tools setup ==

Using the Evaluation Kit (PCA10001), you must:
 # download and install Keil MDK-ARM Lite from [https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm here] to your hard drive. Keil downloads to c:\Keil\unless you change the location when installing.
 # download and run the J-Link Software and documentation pack for Windows from [http://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html here]. The serial number from your SEGGER J-Link hardware is needed to identify your device.
 # Register an account on [www.nordicsemi.com www.nordicsemi.com] and enter the product key of your evaluation board. This make it possible to download documents and the nRF51 SDK installer. Be sure to download the installer and not the zipped folder, this avoid annoying setup of the SDK. Finally run the SDK installer.
In this tutorial I've used nrf51 SDK v.6.0.0.43681.

More information on setup [https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/user/login/?next=Products/Bluetooth-Smart-Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF51822-Evaluation-Kit?resource=18974 here] (you must be registered on Nordic Semiconductor's website).

== Hot to download the example code into the board ==

 # Make sure that KEIL uVision is correctly setted: open the application and click on _File>Device Database.._. You must see the nRF51822 device in the list.

 # Once uVision is ok, let's to locate the Blinky project under _<keil path>\ARM\Device\Nordic\nRF51822\Board\PCA10001\blinky_example\arm_.
 # Open the Blinky project in Keil Î¼Vision by double clicking the _blinky.uvprojfile_.
 # Select nRF51822from the Select Target list and click Buildor press F7to compile the Blinky project.
 # Click the Load icon to download and run the Blinky example firmware. LED 0and LED 1on the PCA10001 should now blink sequentially.
