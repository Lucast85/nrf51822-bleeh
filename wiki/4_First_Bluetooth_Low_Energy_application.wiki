Bluetooth standard is a standard for personal area network allowing short range and low power. Effective ranges varies from 1 meter to 100 meter.
Bluetooth uses a radio technology called frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) allowing to make a very robust link. It operates in the ISM 2.4 GHz band.

Since 1999 the SIG (Special Interest Group) has released 4 different major specifications:
 * BR (specification 1.1): Basic Rate, 1 Mbit/s;
 * EDR (specification 2.0): Enhanced Data Rate, 2 and 3 Mbit/s;
 * HS (specification 3.0): High Speed (Alternate MAC/PHY);
 * LE (specification 4.0): Low Energy, 1 Mbit/s, ultra low power;
Bluetooth low energy is not backward compatible with the older version thus SIG introduces two new terms for separate them:
 * Bluetooth Smart (4.0): Single Mode, LE only radio;
 * Bluetooth Smart Ready (4.0): Dual mode, BR/EDR and LE dual radio;

The nRF51822 support only Bluetooth low energy mode.
