#summary Setup of a blank project and development of comparator's driver using an external button to trigger the comparator during development and experimental phases

= Introduction =

Here are described the setup of a blank project, the hardware to test the comparator (a button and a simple debouncing RC circuit) and the development of the comparator's driver.

== The setup of a blank project ==

== The circuit to test the comparator ==

To emulate the voltage pulse due to the crossing of the magnet above the coil was build a simple circuit. The circuit consists of a button (SW1) to trigger a positive voltage (Vcc=3 V) on a MCU's comparator pin (P0.03) and a one-pole RC circuit (R1 and C1) that remove the button's bounces.

The R-C circuit has a charge-time-constant tc=10 ms and a discharge-time-constant td=20 ms thus the mechanical bounces are bypassed and button presses could be detected.
