#summary Setup of a blank project and development of comparator's driver using an external button to trigger the comparator during development and experimental phases

= Introduction =

Here are described the setup of a blank project, the hardware to test the comparator (a button and a simple debouncing RC circuit) and the development of the comparator's driver.

== The setup of a blank project ==

== The circuit to test the comparator ==

To emulate the voltage pulse due to the crossing of the magnet above the coil was build a simple circuit. The circuit consists of a button that trigger a positive voltage an a MCU's comparator pin and a one-pole RC circuit that remove the button's bounces.
