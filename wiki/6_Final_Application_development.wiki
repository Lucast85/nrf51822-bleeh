= Introduction =
Here are described the modifies to nrf51-ble-app-lbs-master code available on [https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf51-ble-app-lbs GitHub]. And described [https://code.google.com/p/nrf51822-bleeh/wiki/4_First_Bluetooth_Low_Energy_application here].
Mains modifies to actuate are:
 # delete the LED characteristic and others minor changes;
 # add LPCOMP functionality and measure speed with help of RTC and LFCLK using code of [https://code.google.com/p/nrf51822-bleeh/wiki/2b_Development_of_Comparator_Driver 2b_Development_of_Comparator_Driver] and [https://code.google.com/p/nrf51822-bleeh/wiki/3_Study_and_Development_of_UltraLowPower_Techniques 3_Study_and_Development_of_UltraLowPower_Techniques] wiki pages;
 # modify the BUTTON characteristic replacing button status data with speed data computed at point "2";
 # update connection parameters programmatically (related with bicycle's speed) (tips [https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/12545/update-connection-parameter-programmatically/?answer=12551#post-id-12551 here]);
 # delete all extra functionality minimizing current consumption (tips [https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/5186/how-to-minimize-current-consumption-for-ble-application-on-nrf51822/ here]);

==1 Delete the LED characteristic and other minor changes==

The code could be downloaded from GitHub into your PC. Note that in order to work properly, the code must be copied into a specific folder (../nrf51822/Board/pca10001/s110/), otherwise the header files and source files of the libraries will not found. However I copied this files in the project folder, into the "Include" and "Source" folders and I've modify some project's options to have portability feature. 

The first simple modify is to change device's name. The file main.c at row 44 is modified as follow:
{{{
#define DEVICE_NAME                     "BLE Speed Sensor"                          /**< Name of device. Will be included in the advertising data. */
}}}
